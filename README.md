## Prerequisites
Sign up for an [IBM Cloud account](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/).

## Develop your chatbot conversation

### Step 1. Create Watson Assistant service on IBM Cloud
With IBM Watsonâ„¢ Assistant service you can build a solution that understands natural-language input and uses machine learning to respond to customers in a way that simulates a conversation between humans.

Go to your IBM Cloud account and open the catalog. Look for Watson Assistant service and click on it.

Choose the region and space where you want the service to be created. In new accounts it will automatically select your resource group, usually named as default. 
You don't need to change the name if you don't want to, just click on 'Create'.

### Step 2. Import a conversation
Once the service is created click on 'Launch tool' to access it.

In the home tab you have videos and tutorials on how to get started building dialoges. Feel free to explore them. 
Let's move to the Skills tab.

<img src="/readme_images/WA5b.png" width="50%" height="50%">
 

The natural-language processing happens inside a skill, which is a container for all of the artifacts that define the conversation flow for an application.

You can create a new skill and start from scratch or import an existing conversation. 

Click the **Import workspace** icon in the Watson Assistant service tool. Specify the location of the workspace JSON file in your local copy of the app project:

    `<project_root>/training/bank_simple_workspace.json`

Download assistant conversation from here: https://ibm.box.com/v/assistantUI 

Click on the 'Create new' button and then click on the import skill tab.

When you import a skill, you can choose to import only the intents and entities, which can be useful if you want to build a new dialog using the same training data. In this case we will import everything. Click on 'Choose JSON file ' button and find the file you just downloaded. Then click on Import.

### Step 3. Test your dialog
As you make changes to your dialog, you can test it at any time to see how it responds to input.
From the Dialog tab, click the conversation bubble icon. In the chat panel, type some text and then press Enter.
Check the response to see if the dialog correctly interpreted your input and chose the right response. 

The chat window indicates what intents and entities were recognized in the input. In the dialog editor pane, the currently active node is highlighted
Feel free to create new intents for your bot.

### Step 9. Get Watson Assistant credentials 
Once you have tested the dialoge, it's time to collect the credentials to take them to our Node-RED application. 
Click on the Skills name and go back to the Skills overview. 

<img src="/readme_images/WA-1.png" width="40%" height="40%">

Click on the 3 dots in your Assistant to open a menu and then click on View API details. 

<img src="/readme_images/WA-2.png" width="40%" height="40%">

Copy the credentials and save them for later. You will need the Workspace ID (skill), username ('apikey') and password.

## Deploy the application to IBM Cloud

<a href="https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sandra-calvo/assistant-simple&branch=master"><img src="https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png" alt="Deploy to IBM Cloud"></a>

## Configuring the application

The application will not run till you enter your Watson Assitant credentials. Open the Git to see the application code. 

Open the *.env* file and add the service credentials that you obtained in the previous step. The Watson SDK automaticaly locates the correct enviromental variables for either `username`, `password`, and `url` or the `apikey` and `url` credentials found in the *.env* file.

    Example *.env* file that configures the `apikey` and `url` for a Watson Assistant service instance hosted in the US East region:

    ```
    ASSISTANT_IAM_APIKEY=X4rbi8vwZmKpXfowaS3GAsA7vdy17Qh7km5D6EzKLHL2
    ASSISTANT_URL=https://gateway-wdc.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api
    ```

    - If your service instance uses `username` and `password` credentials, add the `ASSISTANT_USERNAME` and `ASSISTANT_PASSWORD` variables to the *.env* file.

    Example *.env* file that configures the `username`, `password`, and `url` for a Watson Assistant service instance hosted in the US South region:

    ```
    ASSISTANT_USERNAME=522be-7b41-ab44-dec3-g1eab2ha73c6
    ASSISTANT_PASSWORD=A4Z5BdGENrwu8
    ASSISTANT_URL=https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api
    ```
    However, if your credentials contain an IAM API key, copy the `apikey` and `url` to the relevant fields.
    ```JSON
      {
        "apikey": "ca2905e6-7b5d-4408-9192-e4d54d83e604",
        "iam_apikey_description": "Auto generated apikey during resource-key ...",
        "iam_apikey_name": "auto-generated-apikey-62b71334-3ae3-4609-be26-846fa59ece42",
        "iam_role_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Manager",
        "iam_serviceid_crn": "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam...",
        "url": "https://gateway-syd.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api"
      }
    ```
    ```
    ASSISTANT_IAM_APIKEY=ca2905e6-7b5d-4408-9192-e4d54d83e604
    ASSISTANT_IAM_URL=https://gateway-syd.watsonplatform.net/assistant/api
    ```

7. Add the `WORKSPACE_ID` to the previous properties

    ```
    WORKSPACE_ID=522be-7b41-ab44-dec3-g1eab2ha73c6
    ```
Once you commit the changes the application will start and you will be able to test your chatbot in your given URL. 
To check the URL go to: 

## Running locally

Clone the repository to your machine.

1. Install the dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the application

    ```
    npm start
    ```

3. View the application in a browser at `localhost:3000`

Make sure you modified the .env file with your own credentials. 

## Deploying to IBM Cloud as a Cloud Foundry Application

1. Login to IBM Cloud with the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html#overview)

    ```
    ibmcloud login
    ```

1. Target a Cloud Foundry organization and space.

    ```
    ibmcloud target --cf
    ```

1. Edit the *manifest.yml* file. Change the **name** field to something unique.  
  For example, `- name: my-app-name`.
1. Deploy the application

    ```
    ibmcloud app push
    ```

1. View the application online at the app URL.
